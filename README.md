# Government Employee Demographic Analysis (Davidson County)

This repository contains an analysis of the demographic distribution of government employees in Davidson County, focusing on age, gender, and race. The objective is to evaluate the diversity of the workforce and identify areas for improvement in equity and inclusion.


## Motivation

My motivation for undertaking this project is deeply rooted in my experience of living in Nashville since 2002. Over the years, I have witnessed the city's dramatic growth and increasing diversity. As I consider a career change, I am particularly interested in assesssing how inclusive the government workforce in Nashville is.
I believe diversity is very important in any workplace. It brings different perspectives, boosts creativity, increases employee engagement, leads to better decisions, and improves the company's reputation. 
## Data Questions

## Challenge
During this analysis, I faced a few challenges. One significant difficulty was downloading the CSV data from the census. The data was not in a dataframe format, which made it cahallenging to work with initially. Additionally, the dataset was not as comprehensive as I had hoped, lacking some key information that would have provided deeper insights.
